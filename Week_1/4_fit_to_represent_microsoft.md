<h3> Growing up in Nigeria and watching the news or in a similar setting you'd have heard when someone represents The President or The Governor at an event. That is instead of attending in person, The President or The Governor or whoever it is, sends someone on his/her behalf to represent them there. Believe it or not, as a Microsoft Student Ambassador, people see you as an Microsoft personified to them and how you act greatly influences their perception of Microsoft as a Company. Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors are unofficial Microsoft Cloud Advocates, we advocate for Microsoft and for technology, and our actions reflect on the Company. <h3>

# Who you should be before becoming a Student Ambassador.

To become a Student Ambassador, you need to embody the role even before you officially become one. What does that mean?

Previously, the application process for the program considered students who were already living the ambassadorship mindset and those who showed potential to do so if given the opportunity. While this still applies to both groups, the emphasis now is on those who are already living it and have shown a strong dedication to prove they can continue doing so. For those with potential, they must demonstrate at least the required skills to live up to the role.

So, who should you be? You should strive to be an ["exemplar"](https://www.google.com/search?q=exemplar)

# How you should be before becoming a Student Ambassador.

This is how you should behave in your life, not just as a Student Ambassador for Microsoft, but also for your personal reputation. Imagine if you owned a brand, company, or business and needed someone to manage your social media presence. You would definitely not hire someone who posts inappropriate content, gets involved in online arguments, or has a bad public image. The same principle applies here.

As a Student Ambassador representing Microsoft, it's crucial that you have a good character and maintain a positive image on social media. This means having a reputation for being responsible and respected, rather than just focusing on the number of followers or connections you have on different platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook.

**Why is this so important?** As mentioned earlier, you are representing Microsoft and serving as its face in your community and wherever you act as a Student Ambassador. Once you become a Microsoft Student Ambassador, you take on a new role and responsibility, whether you like it or not. People will look up to you, and your words and actions will greatly influence their own behavior and decisions.

Now, let's consider this from another point of view. In our interconnected world, many of the people you interact with online don't know you in person. They can only form an impression of you based on what you share about yourself on the internet. During the review of applications for this Mentorship Program, we checked your social background to understand who you are and if your online presence, including your activities, aligns with the information you provided in your written responses. That's exactly how people will judge you based on your online activities. They will make a connection between your actions on the internet and your role as a Student Ambassador, which indirectly reflects on Microsoft, the company you represent. It's important to realize that this is about who you are as an individual even before becoming a Student Ambassador.

Remember, the internet never forgets, and people are observing your actions.

# Back to the question, are you fit to represent Microsoft?

After exploring the expectations and responsibilities of a Microsoft Student Ambassador, it's time to reflect on whether you possess the qualities necessary to represent Microsoft effectively. Being a Student Ambassador means embodying the values and principles of Microsoft even before officially assuming the role. So, let's delve deeper into what it means to be a suitable representative.

First and foremost, consider the significance of representation itself. Think about when someone is chosen to represent the President or Governor at an event. Similarly, as a Microsoft Student Ambassador, people perceive you as the embodiment of Microsoft in their eyes. Your actions and behavior have a profound impact on their perception of Microsoft as a company. Keep in mind that Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors serve as unofficial Microsoft Cloud Advocates, advocating for both Microsoft and technology as a whole. Therefore, your conduct directly reflects on the reputation of the company you represent.

To assess your fitness for this role, let's revisit the qualities and attributes required before becoming a Student Ambassador. In the past, the application process considered individuals who either already possessed the ambassadorship mindset or demonstrated potential to develop it. While this criterion still holds true, greater emphasis is now placed on candidates who are already living up to the expectations and have displayed unwavering dedication. Those with potential must also showcase the essential skills necessary to fulfill the role effectively.

In essence, who should you be? Aspiring to be an exemplar is key. An exemplar is someone who not only embodies the values and principles of Microsoft but also serves as an inspiration and role model to others. It entails consistently demonstrating good character, both online and offline. Consider the analogy of managing the social media presence of a brand or business â€“ inappropriate content, online arguments, or a negative public image would be detrimental to its reputation. The same principle applies to representing Microsoft as a Student Ambassador. Your character and maintaining a positive image on social media are vital, transcending the mere numbers of followers or connections you have on various platforms.

Understanding the importance of your role as a Microsoft Student Ambassador is paramount. You become the face of Microsoft in your community and wherever you represent the company. Once you assume this position, you automatically take on a new level of responsibility, whether you fully comprehend it or not. People will look up to you, seeking guidance and inspiration. Your words and actions hold the power to influence their behavior and decisions.

Moreover, the interconnected nature of our digital world demands cautious consideration. The majority of your online interactions occur with individuals who may never meet you in person. Their perception of you is formed solely based on the content you share on the internet. Hence, during the evaluation process for the Mentorship Program, your social background was assessed to gain insight into who you are and to ensure your online presence aligns with the values you conveyed in your written responses. Remember, people will judge you based on your online activities, establishing a connection between your actions on the internet and your role as a Student Ambassador. This association indirectly reflects on Microsoft as a company.

In conclusion, the question remains: Are you fit to represent Microsoft? Assess your character, commitment, and alignment with the principles of Microsoft. Consider the impact you can make as a Student Ambassador and the responsibility and values that comes with it. The internet has a lasting memory, and individuals are keenly observing your actions. If you believe you possess the qualities necessary to fulfill this role, embrace the opportunity and continue your journey towards leadership.
