## Now, let's begin :fire:

In Week 1, we’ll introduce you to the MLSA Program, its benefits and responsibilities as well as Leadership, what it entails and how MLSAs are Leaders. You’ll learn of past and current Student Ambassadors, highlighting their achievements and how they’ve made a difference by being a Student Ambassador. Then you’ll learn about the necessary skills needed to become a successful applicant, including technical skills and personal branding.
You’ve been assigned a Mentor who'll be your guide and go-to for support throughout the program, reach out to them if you need help or ask your questions in the general Workspace. 

# But first...
