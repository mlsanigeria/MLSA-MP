<h3> <b> Ubuntu!</b> Congratulations and welcome to the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Mentorship Program.</h3> <br>

Have you heard it before? Whether or not you have, welcome to the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Mentorship Program. If you did not already know; 

- We received 360 applications. 
- We selected only 30 Mentees.
- You are 1 of the 30 selected Mentees and 360 applicants. That means you were in the top 8.3% of applicants to get in.😎

You can agree that you are special, and that you’ve got what it takes to do this, we saw it in you. Take a moment to brag about it on social media by sharing this [image](https://getdp.co/mlsamp) on Twitter(See a sample [tweet here](https://twitter.com/devgenix/status/1649022294289788931)), LinkedIn, Instagram or Facebook using this hashtag [#mlsamp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mlsamp).

## Now what next?
 
You are here and we know why. 🤸
Over the next weeks in May, we’ll be taking you on a journey where you’ll become a Micrsoft Learn Student Ambassador before you become a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. 
How? Leave that to us. 😁
